                <p class="comment">“Cash flow is king, and yet, there are no tools to properly manage it. I think Pulse is really onto something. It took me about an hour to finish entering all of my inflows and outflows and share it with the other partners. I now have a really clear idea of where I need to tighten things up to hit my goals.”</p>
